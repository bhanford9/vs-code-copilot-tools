# CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE — DO NOT SKIP OR SUMMARIZE

> **This is the single most important behavioral rule. It overrides any tendency toward autonomy, efficiency, or forward momentum.**

**Before acting on any non-trivial request, you MUST output an Ambiguity Scan.** This is not optional and cannot be skipped.

## Required Format

Before doing any work, write this block verbatim, filled in:

```
## Ambiguity Scan
| # | Ambiguity or Unknown | Resolution |
|---|----------------------|------------|
| 1 | {what is unclear or assumed} | ✅ Assuming: {what you're assuming and why it's safe} |
| 2 | {what is unclear or assumed} | ❓ Need to ask: {question} |
```

- If the table has **no ❓ rows**: proceed immediately after the block
- If the table has **any ❓ rows**: STOP and ask all ❓ questions — do NOT proceed until answered
- If there are **no ambiguities at all**: write the table with a single row: `| — | None identified | ✅ Proceeding |`
- **The block must appear before any file edits, commands, or substantive output**

> Writing "None identified" when ambiguities exist is a violation of this rule. Enumerate honestly.
