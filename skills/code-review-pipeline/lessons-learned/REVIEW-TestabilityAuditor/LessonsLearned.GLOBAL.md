## When to Append an Entry

Only append if the session revealed something surprising, a false positive pattern, or a finding worth noting for future testability reviews. If the review ran smoothly using existing knowledge, skip the update.

## 2026-04-22 — Toggle-always-disabled makes ON branches dead code

**Pattern**: When a test fixture uses `ToggleBuilder.AllDisabled().Build()` as the sole `IToggles` instance, any `if (_toggles.IsEnabled(...))` branch in the test assertions is unreachable dead code — tests appear green while the toggle-ON path is completely uncovered.

**Testability signal**: Look for `if/else` blocks inside test methods that condition on a toggle state where the toggle instance is always `AllDisabled()`. The enabled branch will never execute.

**Recommendation**: Flag as medium-priority. The fix is to introduce a second `IToggles` instance built with `.Enable(FeatureToggle.X)`, or use `[TestCase(true), TestCase(false)]` parameterization.

## 2026-04-22 — Default interface members (DIMs) that `new` concrete types are NOT a testability blocker when mocked

**Pattern**: An interface may declare default members whose bodies `new` real concrete types (e.g., `IFlowDecision EstimateX => new EstimateX()`). When Moq mocks the interface and explicitly `.Setup()` these members, Moq intercepts the property getter and the `new` is never invoked in tests.

**Risk**: If a test forgets to `.Setup()` a DIM, Moq's default behavior is to return `null` (for strict) or invoke the real default (for loose mocks). Use `MockBehavior.Strict` on such mocks to force an immediate, clear failure instead of silent execution of real production code.

**Recommendation**: Flag the absence of `MockBehavior.Strict` as a low/medium issue when an interface has DIMs that construct real types.
