## Dead Toggle Assertions in Test Fixtures

**Category: Process/Model**

When reviewing tests that gate assertions on a feature toggle, check whether the toggle instance used in the fixture (`_toggles = ToggleBuilder.AllDisabled().Build()`) makes any `if (_toggles.IsEnabled(...))` assertion branches permanently dead code. This pattern is common when a developer adds toggle-aware test branching but forgets to create a second toggle instance with the toggle enabled.

- Rating this as **Critical** is correct when the dead branch is the primary behavior change under test (not just a parallel path).
- Do NOT downgrade to Medium just because the developer has written the expected-log arrays — the arrays being present means they thought about it, but the code never executes.
- Recommend: extract to parameterized `[TestCase(true/false)]` pattern OR add a parallel `_togglesOn` fixture field. Both are valid; mention both so developer can choose.
